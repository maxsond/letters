# Designing a game is like creating a sentence.
# There is a subject: The player.
# There is a verb: What the player does.
# There are also direct and indirect objects: The consequences of the player's actions.

# Create a static cast of characters
# Create a library of ad libs
# 

# Handles interface stuff like loading and saving
import game
# Handles events and their consequences
import storyteller
# Handles abstract character interactions and motivations
import actors
# Handles letter generation
import scribe
# Handles "first-person" mode
import map

# Here's where we draft the letters


#c = Character('Male', 'Malkav')

#a = Letter()
#print a.salutation['tender'], c.name, ","
#print "How are you?"
#print a.closing['tender']
#print c.name

print map.prison.look()
